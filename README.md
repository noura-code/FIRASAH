2:  second is to open the code file in Collab

 3: After opening the code, we run the code and click on the first box, then we copy the link from Google while logging into the account on which the data was loaded, copy the link and paste it in the box and then press the "Enter" button "

 4: After the training process is completed, we turn on the second box, then the camera is opened and the classification process begins
